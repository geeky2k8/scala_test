## Installation required

## Step 1: Shopping cart
You are building a checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.  

Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.

Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs the total cost

For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => Â£2.05

Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many candidates take a list of strings as input
 
## Step 2: Simple offers

The shop decides to introduce two new offers

buy one, get one free on Apples

3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
